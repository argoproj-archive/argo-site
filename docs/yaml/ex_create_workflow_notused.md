# Creating a Workflow

So far, you’ve looked at container templates for checking out code and building code, but how do you put everything together? That's where workflow templates come in! Workflows allow you to use other templates as steps in a larger process. Workflows may themselves be nested and used as steps in other workflows.

The following workflow template checks out code and then builds it.

<div xmlns="">

type: workflow

name: example-workflow

description: Example workflow

inputs:

  parameters:

    commit:

      default: "%%session.commit%%"

    repo:

      default: "%%session.repo%%"

steps:

-

  checkout:

    template: applatix-checkout

-

  build:

    template: example-build

    parameters:

      code: "%%steps.checkout.code%%"

</div>

The workflow template takes two input parameters named commit and repo.

The workflow consists of two steps, called checkout and build.

The checkout step simply invokes the applatix-checkout template that you previously defined. Since the template takes two optional parameters, the example just uses the default values.

The build step invokes the example-build template with one parameter,code, which is bound to the code artifact generated by the preceding checkout step. In other words, the output artifact from the checkout step is used as an input artifact to the build step.

Let's extend this example and add some tests as well.

<div xmlns="">

type: workflow

name: example-workflow

description: Example workflow

inputs:

  parameters:

    commit:

      default: "%%session.commit%%"

    repo:

      default: ”%%session.repo%%"

steps:

-

  checkout:

    template: applatix-checkout

-

  build:

    template: example-build

    parameters:

      code: "%%steps.checkout.code%%"

-

  test1:

    template: example-test

    parameters:

      code: "%%steps.checkout.code%%"

      binary: "%%steps.build.binary%%"

      testcase: 1

  test2:

    template: example-test

    parameters:

      code: "%%steps.checkout.code%%"

      binary: "%%steps.build.binary%%"

      testcase: 2

</div>

This workflow is very similar to the previous workflow except for one difference—there are now parallel test steps. Note that steps that are not separated by a "-" are run in parallel.
