# Tutorial 1: Run a CI Pipeline

This tutorial shows you how to run a container-native, CI pipeline on Kubernetes using the Argo workflow engine. An Argo Workflow consists of steps and every step runs as a container within a Kubernetes pod. These are the steps you'll run in the sample CI pipeline:

* Checkout code
* Build the code
* Run multiple tests in parallel
* Send an approval email
* Release the binary

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes the following:

* You have successfully [installed Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-site/get-started/installation).
* You have integrated Argo with the sample CI workflow repo at [https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow](https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow)
* (CLI only) You have logged into the Argo command line. To do this, go to your terminal, cd to the directory for the Argo install, and enter the following information at the command-line prompt:

  * `$ argo login`
  * Press enter for "Enter a configuration name (default):" (this takes the default value)
  * *your_Argo_cluster_URL* for "Enter cluster URL:"
  * *your_email_address* for "Enter cluster username:"
  * *your_Argo_cluster_password* for "Enter cluster password:"
<!--Config written to: /Users/<your_name>/.argo/default-->

## About the YAML Files

The CI workflow uses 4 YAML files from the repo at  [https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow/.argo](https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow):

* `example-workflow-approval.yaml` - defines the CI workflow
* `argo-checkout.yaml` - defines a container that Argo provides for checking out code from your repo to an AWS S3 bucket that your workflow steps can access.
* `argoapproval.yaml` - defines a container that Argo provides for sending email for approval.
* `example-build.yaml` - specifies a Go container to perform a golang build.

## Run Argo Sample CI Workflow

### From Argo CLI:

```

$ argo job submit example-workflow-approval --argument "parameters.REQUIRED_APPROVALS=<your_email_address>" --repo https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow.git

```

Get the job ID of the running job:

```

$ argo job list

```

Get the status of a job:

```

$ argo job show <job_ID>

```

### From Argo Web UI
1. Go to the **Catalog** menu in the Argo Web UI, select **CI Workflow**  and click **Run**.
1. For the workflow parameter called **REQUIRED_APPROVALS**, enter your email address as the approver--this is a mandatory input parameter for the approval step.
1. Click **Submit**.
1. When you receive the approval email, click **Approve**.

 You can see the workflow status in the Argo Web UI. You can also check the logs and artifacts generated by each step:

## Customize Your CI Workflow

1. In your own repo, create a directory called `.argo`. (The Argo Workflow Engine uses this directory to look for the YAML files to run for a containerized workflow.)
1. Copy the YAML templates you ran in the sample CI workflow from [https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow/.argo](https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow/tree/master/.argo) to the `.argo` folder you just created in your repo.
1. Customize the `example-workflow-approval.yaml` file by writing your own build, test, and release containers.
	For more details about writing the YAML DSL see [Argo YAML DSL Reference](./../yaml/dsl_reference_intro.md).
1. 	Integrate your repo with Argo. In Argo Web UI, select **Administration > Integrations > SCM**. Once integrated, the Argo Web UI will display your source code commits in the **Timeline** menu item.


## Run Your Custom CI Workflow


 You have two options for running your customized CI workflow:

 * **Manually**

 From Argo CLI

 You run the same CLI command as shown above except you add two input parameters, `commit` and `repo`, to your workflow like this:

  ```

  $ argo job submit example-workflow-approval --argument "parameters.REQUIRED_APPROVALS=<your_email_address>" --argument "parameters.COMMIT=<commit_id>" --argument "parameters.REPO=h<url_to_your_repo>

  ```

  (Optional) If you want your CI-Workflow to show up in your Catalog menu, just copy the `example-approval-project.yaml` file into the `.argo` directory in your repo. This YAML file defines how to add a CI workflow item in your Catalog.

  From Argo Web UI
	1. Go to **Timeline** menu, select a commit and click **Create a New Job**.
	1. Select the CI workflow name, enter values for the input parameters and click **Submit**.  

    (Optional) If you want your CI-Workflow to show up in your Catalog menu, just copy the `example-approval-project.yaml` file into the `.argo` directory of your repo. This YAML file defines how to add a CI workflow item in your Catalog.


* **Automatically**

	1. Copy the `example-policy.yaml` file to the `.argo` directory in your repo and modify it as needed.
	1. Enable your policy template. (**Templates** > <*name_of_policy_template* > and click **Enabled**)

	 NOTE: The automatic feature is only available through the Argo Web UI.

 After you've completed these steps, every time you make a commit in your repo, the CI workflow is automatically triggered.
