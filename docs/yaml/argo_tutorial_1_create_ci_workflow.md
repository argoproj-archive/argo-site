# Tutorial 1: Run a CI Workflow


This tutorial shows you how to run a container-native, CI workflow on Kubernetes using the Argo workflow engine. An Argo Workflow consists of steps and every step runs as a container within a Kubernetes pod. These are the steps you'll run in the sample CI workflow:

* Check out code
* Build the code
* Run multiple tests in parallel
* Send an approval email
* Release the binary

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes the following:

* You have successfully [installed Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-site/#/get-started/installation).
* You have integrated Argo with the sample CI workflow repo at [https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow](https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow)

## About the YAML Files

The CI workflow uses 4 YAML files from the repo at  [https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow/.argo](https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow/tree/master/.argo):

* `example-workflow-approval.yaml` - contains the workflow steps that checks out code, builds code, runs multiple tests in parallel, sends an approval email, and releases the binary.
* `argo-checkout.yaml` - defines a container that Argo provides for checking out code from your repo to an AWS S3 bucket that your workflow steps access.
* `argoapproval.yaml` - defines a container that Argo provides for sending email for approval.
* `example-build.yaml` -  specifies a Go container to perform a golang build.

## Run Argo Sample CI Workflow

To run the workflow, you'll perform these tasks:

* Go to the **Catalog** menu in the Argo Web UI, select **CI Workflow**  and click **Run**.
* For the workflow parameter called **REQUIRED_APPROVALS**, enter your email address as the approver--this is a mandatory input parameter for the approval step.
* Click **Submit**.
* When you receive the approval email, click **Approve**.

You can see the workflow status in the Argo Web UI. You can also check the logs and artifacts generated by each step:

## Customizing Your CI Workflow

* In your own repo, create a directory called `.argo`. (The Argo Workflow engine uses this directory to look for the YAML files to run for a containerized workflow.)

* Copy the YAML templates you ran in the sample CI workflow from [https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow/.argo](https://github.com/argoproj/ci-workflow/tree/master/.argo) to the `.argo` folder you just created in your repo.

* Customize the `example-workflow-approval.yaml` file by writing your own build, test, and release containers.

For more details about writing the YAML DSL see [Argo YAML DSL Reference](#/docs;doc=yaml%2Fdsl_reference_intro.md).

## Running Your Custom CI Workflow

When you integrate your repo with Argo, the Argo Web UI will display your source code commits in the **Timeline** menu item.


 You have two options for running your customized CI workflow:

 * **Manually**
	 - Go to **Timeline**.
	 - Select a commit.
	 - Click **Create a New Job**.
	 - Select the CI workflow name and enter values for the input parameters.
	 - Click **Submit**.

   (Optional) As a convenience, Argo also lets you run your workflow from the **Catalog**. The benefit of using the Catalog is it allows multiple users to easily run the workflow through the Argo Web UI. If you want your CI-Workflow to show up in your Catalog menu, just copy the `example-approval-project.yaml` file into the `.argo` directory in your repo. This YAML file defines how to add a CI workflow item in your Catalog.


 * **Automatically**

   - Create a Policy template. (TIP: Copy the `example-policy.yaml` file to the `.argo` directory in your repo and modify it as needed.)
   - Enable your policy template. (**Templates** > *name_of_policy_template* > and click **Enabled**)  
   <br/>

   After you've completed these steps, every time you make a commit in your repo, the CI workflow is automatically triggered.
