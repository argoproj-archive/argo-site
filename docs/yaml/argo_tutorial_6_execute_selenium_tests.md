# Tutorial 6: Run Selenium Tests using nested workflows

This tutorial shows how to use nested workflows to:

*   run a Selenium test against a web application ("Hello World") that runs in a web browser (Chrome)
*   record and output a video of screenshots taken during the test

In this tutorial, you'll run multiple steps, which are grouped into nested workflows.

## Prerequisites

  This tutorial assumes the following:

  * You have successfully [installed Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-site/get-started/installation).
  * You have integrated Argo with Appstore containing sample selenium test [https://github.com/argoproj/appstore/](https://github.com/argoproj/appstore/).
  * (CLI only) You have logged into the Argo command line. To do this, go to your terminal, cd to the directory for the Argo install, and enter the following information at the command-line prompt:

    * `$ argo login`
    * Press enter for "Enter a configuration name (default):" (this takes the default value)
    * *your_Argo_cluster_URL* for "Enter cluster URL:"
    * *your_email_address* for "Enter cluster username:"
    * *your_Argo_cluster_password* for "Enter cluster password:"
  <!--Config written to: /Users/<your_name>/.argo/default-->

## About the YAML Files

The Selenium test workflow uses 3 YAML files from the `.argo` directory of the repo at  [https://github.com/argoproj/appstore/](https://github.com/argoproj/appstore/):

* `argo-checkout.yaml` - creates a container for checking out source code from the repo.
* `selenium_all_ax.yaml` - has several workflows that are nested in this order:
    * top level workflow: `Selenium Demo`, which has these steps:
     * Checks out code from repo for the Selenium app (`argo-checkout`)
     * Runs the nested workflow for performing the Selenium test and video conversion (`selenium-with-video-converter-workflow`)
    * 1st nested workflow: `selenium-with-video-converter-workflow`, which has these steps:
     * Runs the nested workflow (`selenium-test-workflow`) that performs the Selenium test of the app.
     * Runs the container (`video-converter`) that performs the video conversion

       NOTE: The `selenium-test-workflow` declares [managed fixtures](./../user_guide/infrastructure/using_fixtures.md) for the Selenium server, the web app to test in the browsers, and video recorder (`selenium-server`, `selenium-test-app`, and `vnc-recorder`) and creates a container (`selenium-e2e-test`) to run the test.
* `selenium_video_tool.yaml` - defines the containers for recording and converting the video of the Selenium test from `.flv` format to `.mp4` format (`vnc-recorder` and `video-converter`).

NOTE: For more details on the workflow and container YAML DSL please check the YAML tutorial at [Container Template](./../yaml/container_templates.md).

## Run Sample Selenium Test Workflow

### From Argo CLI:

```

argo job submit "Selenium Demo" --argument "parameters.BROWSER=chrome" --argument "parameters.TEST_FAILURE=false" --repo https://github.com/argoproj/appstore.git


```

Get the job ID of the running job:


```

$ argo job list


```

Get the status of a job:


```

$ argo job show <job_ID>


```


### From Argo Web UI

1. In the Argo Web UI, select **Catalog** > **Demo** > **Selenium testing** and click **TEST**.
1. Click **Submit** to start the job with nested workflows.

  You will see the workflow running in Argo Web UI where every step is a container. You can check the log and artifact generated by clicking on each step.

### Viewing the Test Outputs and Artifacts

To view the video output of the Selenium test, go to the specific Job, click **Workflow**, hover your mouse over a container, click **ACTIONS** and select **Download artifact VIDEO** or **Browse artifact VIDEO**.

To view a report of the test, go to the **E2E_TEST** container and click **Download artifact REPORT**.

### Viewing Information for a Test Failure

To view a report of the test failure,  go to the specific Job, click **Workflow**, hover your mouse over the container with a "red" circle, click **ACTIONS**, and select **Browse artifact REPORT**. A dialog opens displaying the results and highlighting the lines that failed.

## Customize Your Selenium Workflow
1. In your own repo, create a directory called `.argo`. (The Argo Workflow engine uses this directory to look for the YAML files to run for a containerized workflow.)
1. Copy the YAML templates you ran in the sample workflow from the `.argo` directory in  [https://github.com/argoproj/appstore/](https://github.com/argoproj/appstore/) to the `.argo` folder you just created in your repo.
1. Customize the `selenium_all_ax.yaml` file by specifying your own app to test or adding more steps.

	For more details about writing the YAML DSL, see [Argo YAML DSL Reference](./../yaml/dsl_reference_intro.md).

1. Integrate your repo with Argo. In Argo Web UI, select **Administration->Integrations->SCM**. Once integrated, the Argo Web UI will display your source code commits in the **Timeline** menu item.

## Running Your Customized Selenium Test Workflow

You have two options for running your selenium workflow:

 * **Manually**

	1. Go to **Timeline** menu, select a commit and click **Create a New Job**.
	1. Select the YAML templates to create a job, click **NEXT**, enter values for the input parameters and click **Submit**.  You can also run all your YAML templates from the **Templates** menu.

    (Optional) If you want to let users run the project from the **Catalog** menu, just copy the `selenium_test_project.yaml` file into the `.argo` directory of your repo and modify it.

 * **Automatically**
  	2. Create and activate a Policy template to trigger this workflow for every commit as shown in [Tutorial 1](./argo_tutorial_1_create_ci_workflow.md).

     After you've completed these steps, every time you make a commit in your repo, the Selenium test workflow is automatically triggered.
