# Building Hello World! Using a Docker Container

Before you run a container on <span class="GeneralApplatix Platform Name">Argo</span>, let's first run a container in a Docker environment on your system. You'll create a template to echo "Hello World!" using the popular UbuntuÂ container pulled from DockerHub.

Once you've [installed Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on your system, you can run the container with a simple `docker run` command to echo "Hello World!"

<div style="font-family: 'Courier New';" xmlns="">

bash% docker run 'Hello World!'

Hello from Docker!
