# Configure Domains for App Access

Argo allows you to control the domains that applications can access for deployment. The Argo Web UI displays the domain values that you configured on AWS for its Route 53 service. If you want to add or delete any domains that Argo can access, go to **Navigation bar** >  **Administration** >  **Settings** > **Domain Management**, make your changes, and click **UPDATE DOMAINS**.
