# Configuring Single Sign-On

The Argo uses the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to securely connect Applatix with an Identity Provider (IdP) and enable single sign-on (SSO). Applatix is the service provider and Active Directory is an example of an Identity Provider.

By default, when a new SAML user is registered with your Argo, the new user is assigned to a developer group, which has restricted permissions to the Cluster. If the new user needs administrative privileges, then you must promote the new user account to an administrative account.

Go to **Configurations** > **Set Up Single Sign-on** and follow these steps for configuring SSO for Argo:

## Step 1 Give Applatix Information to your Identity Provider

To enable single sign-on from your IdP into Applatix, your IdP needs this required information from Applatix:

*   The secure URL for accessing Applatix's SAML service.
*   The secure URL for accessing your Applatix cluster.

(Optional) If your IdP or security system also requires authentication of Applatix with digital certificates, then you must also provide

*   A certificate that contains Applatix's public key.

## Step 2 Configure Applatix for Single sign-on

In this step, you configure Applatix with the information that your IdP provides.

*   Enter the following information for these fields:
    *   SIGN IN BUTTON LABEL - Add a label to a button for SSOÂ that automatically appears on your login page. Your users click this button to perform SSO into the Applatix cluster.
    *   SSO URL - Enter the secure URL that the IdP returns for performing SSO into your security system.
    *   PUBLIC CERTIFICATE - (Optional) If your environment requires authentication of the IdP, you can enter the IdP's certificate with the public key that it returned after setting up SSO with Applatix.
    *   (Optional) Click **Advanced Settings**. Your security system may require the entry of additional attribute values for SSO. Check the documentation for your security system to see if the following values are necessary:
        *   EMAIL ATTRIBUTE (Required)
        *   FIRST NAME ATTRIBUTE (Optional)
        *   LAST NAME ATTRIBUTE (Optional)
        *   GROUP ATTRIBUTE (Optional)
        *   DISPLAY NAME (Optional)
        *   DESCRIPTION (Optional)
    *   (Optional) Check **DEFLATE RESPONSE ENCODED** if your IdP provides an encrypted response and you need it to be decrypted.

**NOTE**: By selecting any of the following 3 options, you are configuring Applatix to respond correctly to a SAML request or response from an IdP provider:

*   (Optional) Check **SIGN REQUEST** if your IdP requires your request to be signed.
*   (Optional) Check **SIGN RESPONSE** if your IdP provides a response that is signed.
*   (Optional) Check **SIGN RESPONSE ASSERTION** if your IdP provides a response assertion that is signed.

*   Click **UPDATE** if you have modified any information.
