# Connect Docker Hub or Your Private Docker Registry to Argo

After connecting to your source control management system, you'll also connect to your public Docker registries to Argo (such as DockerHub or your own private Docker registry). Here's the procedure:

1.  Click Configurations > Connect Docker Hub or Your Registry.

2.  Select the container registry (Docker Hub or Private Registry) where the images reside.
3.  Enter your username and password (or personal access token)
4.  Enter hostname for private registry.

5.  (Optional) Click **TEST** to check the connection before you integrate Argo to the registry.
6.  Click **CONNECT**.

At this point, you can now run a workflow from a commit.
