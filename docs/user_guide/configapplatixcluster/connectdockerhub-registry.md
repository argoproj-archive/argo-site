# Connect Docker Hub or Your Private Docker Registry to Argo

After connecting to your source control management system, you'll also connect Argo to your public Docker registries where your container images reside. Here's the procedure:

1.  Click **Navigation bar** >  **Administration** >  **Integrations** > **Docker Registries**.

2.  Select the container registry (Docker Hub or Private Registry).
3.  Enter your username and password (or personal access token)
4.  Enter hostname for private registry.

5.  (Optional) Click **TEST** to check the connection before you integrate Argo to the registry.
6.  Click **CONNECT**.

At this point, you can now run a workflow from a commit.
