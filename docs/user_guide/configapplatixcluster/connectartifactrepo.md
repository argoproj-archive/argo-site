# Connecting an Artifact Repository to Argo

Argo makes it easy to integrate external artifact repositories. This is useful if you want to use artifacts generated outside the Argo in Argo applications and workflows or wish to share artifacts generated by the Argo system with other systems. Here's how to connect the Argo to an artifact repository:

## To integrate Argo with your artifact repository:

1.  Click **Navigation bar** >  **Administration** >  **Integrations** > **Artifact Repositories**.

3.  Enter your user credentials for the repository.
4.  Enter the hostname (or domain) for your repository and the port number it uses.
5.  (Optional) Click **TEST** to check the connection before you integrate Argo to the repository.
6.  Click **CONNECT**.

To disconnect a repository, click ![](../../../images/pencil_4_editing.png) and click **DISCONNECT**.

# Managing Artifact Retention Policy

The Argo automatically tracks the artifacts that your workflow and Argo generates. There are four types of artifacts that Argo handles:

*   *Exported Artifacts* - artifacts that are accessible globally to other workflows. To learn how to use artifacts as inputs to a workflow and reference exported artifacts, see [Container and Workflow templates](./../../yaml/container_templates.md).
*   *Internal Artifacts* - artifacts that are accessible between steps in a single workflow but not accessible from another workflow.
*   *User Application Logs* - logs generated by the containers that the application runs. To view these logs, see [Managing and Monitoring Your Jobs](./../timeline/create_job-viewhistory.md).
*   *Argo System Logs* - logs generated by Argo.

Argo also stores artifacts for a specified amount of time. You can configure how long you retain the artifacts from the Argo Web UI. Here's how to configure the retention policy:

1.  Click **Navigation bar** > **Administration** > **Settings** > **Artifact Repositories**. (Artifact Retention Policy pane displays)

2.  (Optional) Click **RECLAIM SPACE NOW** if you want to reclaim the storage immediately from all expired artifacts. Argo automatically performs garbage collection of expired artifacts on a daily basis.  

3.  Click **Edit** to modify retention time for various types of artifacts and logs.

4.  Enter the new time (number of days).
5.  Click **SAVE**.
