# Setting Up Notification Management

The Argo sends notification messages with severity levels about events that occur within the Argo system. These messages help you monitor and troubleshoot issues that arise while using the system. Notification messages can also be triggered as a result of automated job policies that you enable.

Administrators can configure the notification rules as to who receives certain types of notifications.

## <a name="UsingPolicies2TriggerNotificationMessage"></a>Using Policies to Trigger a Notification Message

You can enable a policy to automatically run workflows. When you create a policy, you can configure a notification rule to send out an event message when a job succeeds or fails. From the 1. Click **Navigation bar** >  **Administration** > **Settings** > **Notification Rules** screen, you can view the job notification rules from policies.

Just click the name of the policy to see the specific policy details, including **NOTIFICATION** details.

For instructions on how to define a policy, see [Automating Workflows Using Policies](./../../yaml/ex_create_policy_4_workflow.md).

Additionally, you can also write a policy that alerts users as to when certain events happen on the Argo.

# Configure Systems for Sending Notification Messages

Choose the system for sending out notification messages to your users:

*   **SMTP** - Enter the configuration information for your server.
*   **Slack** - To enable Slack with Argo, you must configure both systems to communicate with each other.

## SMTP

1. Click **Navigation bar** >  **Administration** > **Integrations** > **Notifications** > **SMTP**.

2.  Click **+** and enter information for the following fields:
    *   NICKNAME for server
    *   HOST NAME for server (such as email-smtp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com for an SMTP server)
    *   ADMIN ADDRESS (such as admin@company.com)
    *   PORT (Default for SMTP is 587)
    *   TIMEOUT (in seconds)
4.  (Optional) Check **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt all email and to use a secure connection.
5.  (Optional) Check **USE AUTH** if the server requires authentication. If checked, you are required to enter a username and password.
6.  (Optional) Click **TEST** to test the connection to the server (highly recommended).
7.  Click **CONNECT**.

To disconnect an existing server, click the name of the server and click **DISCONNECT**.
