# Viewing, Enabling and Disabling Policies

Policies are a set of rules that determine

*   when certain workflows should run
*   when notifications should be generated
*   whom the notifications should be sent to

Policies help you automate your operational processes. You define policies in a <span class="GeneralYAML template">YAML template</span>. To define a policy, see "Creating a Policy that Triggers a Workflow" in the <span class="GeneralYAML Tutorial">Argo YAML Tutorial and Reference</span>.

To enable or disable the policy, just click **ENABLE** or **DISABLE** at the bottom of the screen.
