# Cashboard

Argo has a "Cashboard" makes it easy to view the total cost of running your Argo. For the time period you select, the Cashboard displays how much you are charged for the instances that are currently running, and the actual utilization of those instances.

Go to **Navigation bar** > **Monitoring** > **Cashboard**.

Simply select the time or date range you want to view: **TODAY**, **YESTERDAY**, **LAST 7 DAYS**, **LAST 15 DAYS**, or **CUSTOM** (Default is the current date.) The Cashboard graph displays this information:

*   The upper white line represents how much you have spent for your instances.
*   The lower blue line (with the area underneath shaded in blue) represents the actual utilization.
*   The horizontal dotted line represents the balance of the time period that has not occurred yet.
*   The vertical line represents the beginning of the unit of time you are viewing.
*   The solid black horizontal line represents the unit of time you are viewing.

Below the Cashboard graph, the Console displays other views of the data, which are organized as follows:

*   **Spending by Templates** - Lists the spending per "top-level" template that is run as a job or deployed as part of an application. Top-level means the template is not nested within another template. Usually, a workflow template (that is not nested within another workflow) would be a top-level template.
*   **Spending by Users** - Lists the spending per user of the Argo in U.S. dollars.
*   **Spending by Applications** - Lists the spending per application. that have An application is a set of long-running deployments. View real-time data about the spend that an application has accumulated.

Click any item in these lists to view more spending details about the template, users or application. For example, clicking a template name displays the accumulated spend for that template and the users who accounted for that cost.

NOTE: **axsys** is an entity that represents all of the underlying processes that support the Argo. The cost of running this entity is included as part of the total cost of running the Argo.
