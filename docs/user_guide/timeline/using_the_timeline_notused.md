*   Specify the time period you want to see the jobs deployed.
*   View job histories per commits on all branches or just your branch.
*   Download any artifacts that were generated by the workflow.
*   Click ![](../docs/images/branches_icon.png) to reveal the Quick Access menu and select the repo branch you want to access

*   Start a job by clicking a specific **COMMIT ID**.

*   Download artifacts generated from a job by clicking the name of the job and clicking **ARTIFACTS**.
