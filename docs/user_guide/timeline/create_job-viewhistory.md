# Creating a Job

When you want to start a job, you must choose which code commit (from a repo branch) to use for the job. If this is the first time you are creating a job for a specific commit, you must select the commit from the Argo Web UI.

Here's the procedure:

1.  Click Timeline > Commits.

    You can filter the commits by date range or by "My commits".

2.  Click the down arrow at the right margin of the row for the commit you are selecting.

3.  Click CREATE NEW JOB.

4.  Under TEMPLATES, select the YAML templates to use for running the job.
5.  Click NEXT.

6.  Under **Review workflow parameters**, enter the appropriate values for each parameter displayed.
7.  Click **SUBMIT** to start the job.

NOTE: If you have already run a job from a specific commit, you can run the same job again without having to select the commit.

# View Templates and Create a Job

The Argo Web UI provides multiple ways to view the YAML templates that a job uses. You can simply click Templates and then click a row in the template table to see the details for a specific template. From this view, you can

*   Start a job from a specific YAML template by clicking ![](../../../images/3_vertical_dots_27x29.png)at the end of each row.
*   View all the available YAML templates from a branch

*   View the WORKFLOW for a given job based on the YAML template. Click any step in the workflow and see the corresponding code in the YAML viewer.

*   View the JOB HISTORY for a YAML template and click the specific job for details about the success or failure of that job.

After you have run a job, you can view the Timeline to see a history of all workflow jobs, commits, and branches. From this screen, you can:

*   Filter for successful or failed jobs by branch.
*   View a summary of jobs that have failed, succeeded, are still in-progress or queued (waiting to run).
*   Specify the time period you want to see the jobs deployed.
*   View job histories per commits on all branches or just your branch.
*   Download any artifacts that were generated by the workflow.
*   Click ![](../../../images/branches_icon.png) to reveal the Quick Access menu and select the repo branch you want to access

*   Start a job by clicking a specific **COMMIT ID**.

*   Download artifacts generated from a job by clicking the name of the job and clicking **ARTIFACTS**.

# Managing and Monitoring Your Jobs

From Timeline > Jobs, you can kick off a job, monitor its progress, view its history and view logs for each YAML template that runs.

*   Start a job from a specific commit

    Filter the jobs history for commits that come from all branches in a repo or just your branch

*   View the workflow details for the job to see which step that the job failed or succeeded.

    In case of a job failure, click the step that failed and click the **YAML** icon to see the code that failed.

*   Resubmit a job (whether it failed or not)

*   View the logs for each step in your workflow. Or to retrieve the logs, click **DOWNLOAD LOGS**.

*   View the job summary (which includes duration, cost of the job and what YAML template was used).

*   View the artifacts that the workflow uses or generates (including the step of the workflow that used or generated the artifact).
