# Creating a Job

When you want to create a job, you must choose which code commit (from a repo branch) to use for the job. If this is the first time you are creating a job for a specific commit, you must select the commit from the <span class="GeneralApplatix Cluster Console">Argo Web UI</span>.

Here's the procedure:

1.  Click <span class="UI_element">Timeline</span> > <span class="UI_element">Commits</span>.

    You can filter the commits by date range or by "<span class="UI_element">My commits</span>".

2.  Click the down arrow at the right margin of the row for the commit you are selecting.

3.  Click <span class="UI_element">CREATE NEW JOB</span>.

4.  Under <span class="UI_element">TEMPLATES</span>, select the <span class="GeneralYAML template">YAML template</span>s to use for running the job.
5.  Click <span class="UI_element">NEXT</span>.

6.  Under **Review workflow parameters**, enter the appropriate values for each parameter displayed.
7.  Click **SUBMIT** to start the job.

NOTE: If you have already run a job from a specific commit, you can run the same job again without having to select the commit.

# View Templates and Create a Job

The <span class="GeneralApplatix Cluster Console">Argo Web UI</span> provides multiple ways to view the <span class="GeneralYAML template">YAML template</span>s that a job uses. You can simply click <span class="UI_element">Templates</span> and then click a row in the template table to see the details for a specific template. From this view, you can

*   Start a job from a specific <span class="GeneralYAML template">YAML template</span> by clicking ![](../docs/images/3_vertical_dots_27x29.png)at the end of each row.
*   View all the available <span class="GeneralYAML template">YAML template</span>s from a branch

*   View the <span class="UI_element">WORKFLOW</span> for a given job based on the <span class="GeneralYAML template">YAML template</span>. Click any step in the workflow and see the corresponding code in the YAML viewer.

*   View the <span class="UI_element">JOB HISTORY</span> for a YAML template and click the specific job for details about the success or failure of that job.

*   View a summary of jobs that have failed, succeeded, are still in-progress or queued (waiting to run).
*   Specify the time period you want to see the jobs deployed.
*   View job histories per commits on all branches or just your branch.

From <span class="UI_element">Timeline</span> > <span class="UI_element">Jobs</span>, you can kick off a job, monitor its progress, view its history and view logs for each <span class="GeneralYAML template">YAML template</span> that runs.

*   Start a job from a specific commit

    Filter the jobs history for commits that come from all branches in a repo or just your branch

*   View the workflow details for the job to see which step that the job failed or succeeded.

    In case of a job failure, click the step that failed and click the **YAML** icon to see the code that failed.

*   Resubmit a job (whether it failed or not)
