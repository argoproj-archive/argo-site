# Managing and Monitoring Your Jobs

From <span class="UI_element">Timeline</span> > <span class="UI_element">Jobs</span>, you can kick off a job, monitor its progress, view its history and view logs for each <span class="GeneralYAML template">YAML template</span> that runs.

*   Start a job from a specific commit

    Filter the jobs history for commits that come from all branches in a repo or just your branch

*   View the workflow details for the job to see which step that the job failed or succeeded.

    In case of a job failure, click the step that failed and click the **YAML** icon to see the code that failed.

*   Resubmit a job (whether it failed or not)

*   View the logs for each step in your workflow. Or to retrieve the logs, click **DOWNLOAD LOGS**.

*   View the job summary (which includes duration, cost of the job and what YAML template was used).

*   View the artifacts that the workflow uses or generates (including the step of the workflow that used or generated the artifact).
