# Building Code and Running a Job

After you connect the <span class="GeneralKubernetes Cluster with Argo">Argo</span> to the desired repo branch and Docker registry, you are now ready to run a workload on the public cloud.

With <span class="GeneralApplatix Platform Name">Argo</span>, there are a couple types of workloads you can run on the Cluster:

*   workflows
*   applications

When you run a workload, this is called a job. A job consists of a workflow that is run by <span class="GeneralYAML template">YAML template</span>s.

Look at these links for instructions about using the <span class="GeneralApplatix Cluster Console">Argo Web UI</span> to:

*   [Start a job from a code commit](#/docs;doc=user_guide%2Ftimeline%2Fcreate_job-viewhistory.md)
*   [View real-time data about the instances and hosts that are running in your cluster](#/docs;doc=user_guide%2Finfrastructure%2Fhosts.md)
*   [View the spend on the job through the Cashboard](#/docs;doc=user_guide%2Fdashboards%2Fcashboard.md)
*   [View a summary of jobs that succeeded, failed or scheduled to run](#/docs;doc=user_guide%2Ftimeline%2Fusing_the_timeline_notused.md)
