# Monitoring, Governance, and Spend

In addition to building, running, and deploying containerized applications in the public cloud, Argo also helps you track your cloud utilization and expenses.

Monitoring your cluster usage and cost is important to keeping your jobs running in the cloud on budget and within time constraints.

Click **Navigation bar** > **Monitoring** and select one of the following icons to:

*   View real-time data about the CPU and memory utilization rate of your instances and containers for your hosts that are running on your Kubernetes **[CLUSTER](./user_guide/dashboards/hosts.md)**.
*   View the spend on a job through the **[CASHBOARD](./user_guide/dashboards/cashboard.md)**.
*   View a summary of the jobs that succeeded, failed, in-progress, or are scheduled to run in **[METRICS](./user_guide/dashboards/metrics.md)**.
