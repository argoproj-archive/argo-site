This example also deploys Zipkin for tracing the application end-to-end.\nPrerequisites\n  This tutorial assumes the following:\n\nYou have successfully installed Argo.\nYou have integrated Argo with Appstore containing Sock shop microservices-based application https://github.com/argoproj/microservices-demo\nYou have created an AWS RDS database instance of type \"PostgreSQL\". Make sure you've taken all default parameters and that Argo can access the database endpoint.\n(CLI only) You have logged into the Argo command line. To do this, go to your terminal, cd to the directory for the Argo install, and enter the following information at the command-line prompt:\n$ argo login\nPress enter for \"Enter a configuration name (default):\" (this takes the default value)\nyour_Argo_cluster_URL for \"Enter cluster URL:\"\nyour_email_address for \"Enter cluster username:\"\nyour_Argo_cluster_password for \"Enter cluster password:\"\n\n\n\n\nAbout the YAML Files\nThe Sock shop workflow uses 1 top-level YAML files from the `.argo directory of the repo at https://github.com/argoproj/microservices-demo:\n\nsock-shop-workflow.yaml - This file defines a workflow that has fourteen deployment templates for deploying sock shop and three deployment templates to deploy Zipkin. These are YAML templates you'll run for the microservices-demo:ß\ncarts-db - deploys the mongoDB database that handles the shopping carts. (Uses named volume to store shopping cart data.)\ncatalogue-db - deploys MySQL database for the catalogue app.\norders-db - deploys mongoDB database for order information. (Uses named volume to store data for orders.)\nqueue-master - deploys this service that reads data from the shipping queue. Specifies Zipkin for tracing.\nrabbitmq - deploys this message broker app.\nsession-db - deploys Redis message broker for tracking session information.\nuser-db - deploys database for tracking users.\nuser - deploys user app running in Zipkin environment.\ncarts - deploys this Java app for shopping carts, running in Zipkin environment. (Uses named volume to store app server files.)\ncatalogue - deploys the catalogue app running in Zipkin environment.\norders - deploys Java app for handling orders, running in Zipkin environment. (Uses named volume to store app server files.)\npayment - deploys payment app, running in Zipkin environment.\nshipping - deploys Java app for handling shipping, running in Zipkin environment. (Uses named volume to store app server files.)\nfront-end - deploys the front-end for the Sock shop application.\nzipkin-mysql - deploys MySQL database for Zipkin app.\nzipkin - deploys Zipkin app.\nzipkin-cron - deploys Zipkin to run as a cron job.\n\n\n\nArgo deployment YAML files internally map to Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files.\nFor more details on the Argo YAML DSL, see Argo YAML DSL Reference.\nDeploy and Scale Sample Sock Shop App\nIMPORTANT: Before you deploy the microservices-based app, you must create six \"named\" volumes for the following services: carts-db, carts, orders-db, orders, shipping, and user-db.\nYou can create these volumes in the Argo Web UI or in the YAML template files.\nUsing the Argo Web UI, go to Infrastructure > Volumes and create six EBS volumes of 1 GB each. Name the volumes as follows:\n\nsock-shop-order-db\nsock-shop-cart\nsock-shop-cart-db\nsock-shop-shipping\nsock-shop-user-db\nsock-shop-order\n\nUsing YAML files, you'll declare the \"named\" volumes in the respective deployment templates. You'll use the same names for the volumes as listed above for the Argo Web UI. To see an example of the named volumes, look at the sock-shop-workflow.yaml file in the .argo directory of https://github.com/argoproj/microservices-demo. For details, see Adding a Volume as Storage for Deployment.\nFrom Argo CLI:\n\n$ argo job submit sock-shop-workflow --argument \"parameters.APP_NAME=sock-shop\" --argument \"parameters.CART_DB_VOL_NAME=sock-shop-cart-db\" --argument \"parameters.CART_VOL_NAME=sock-shop-cart\" --argument \"parameters.ORDERS_DB_VOL_NAME=sock-shop-order-db\" --argument \"parameters.ORDERS_VOL_NAME=sock-shop-order\" --argument \"parameters.SHIPPING_VOL_NAME=sock-shop-shipping\" --argument \"parameters.USER_DB_VOL_NAME=sock-shop-user-db\" --repo https://github.com/argoproj/microservices-demo.git\nGet the job ID of the running job:\n\n$ argo job list\nGet the status of a job:\n\n$ argo job show <job_ID>\nFrom Argo Web UI\n\nConfigure the domains for deployment. This allows you to control which applications can access a deployment. From the Argo Web UI, go to Navigation Bar > Settings > Domain Management, make your changes, and click UPDATE DOMAINS.\n\nFrom Catalog, select Sock Shop App and click Deploy Sock Shop with RDS, taking the default input parameters. Make sure the volume names are entered as the input parameters defined above. For the DBHost parameter, enter the value for your AWS RDS endpoint. You do not have to provide port 5432 for PostgreSQL. Click Submit.\nYou will see the workflow running in Argo Web UI.\n\nOnce the workflow completes, click Applications and you'll see a \"Sock-shop\" application displayed.\nYou can see it has one deployment named sock-shop-deploy, which runs one pod per instance.\n\nClick the \"access-url\" in sock-shop-deploy and you can access the Sock shop application from your browser.\nYou can easily increase the number of pods, view the logs and sh/bash into the container.\nIf you stop or terminate the application and redeploy you can see that the data is persisted.\nTo see the deployed app, click ENDPOINTS and select the URL for the Sock Shop Application.\n\n\nDeploy and Scale Your Custom Stateful App\nCreate your YAML files\n\nCreate an .argo folder under your repository.\nCopy sock-shop-with-rds.yaml from https://github.com/argoproj/microservices-demo to your repo's .argo folder. Customize it with your deployment and container specs\nCreate volumes through YAML or using the Argo Web UI.\n(Optional) If you want Sock shop to show up in your Catalog, copy the microservices-project.yaml from https://github.com/argoproj/microservices-demo to your repo's .argo folder. This YAML file defines how the app shows up in your Catalog menu. You can see and run all your YAML-based workflows from Templates menu in the Argo Web UI.\nIntegrate your repo with Argo. In Argo Web UI, select Administration > Integrations > SCM. Once integrated, the Argo Web UI displays your source code commits in the Timeline menu item.\n\nRunning Your Customized Selenium Test Workflow\nYou have two options for running your selenium workflow:\n\nManually\n\nGo to Templates menu, search for your app name, click +.\nReview the values for the input parameters and click Submit.

You can run them \"as is\" or use them as \"building blocks\" to create more complex workflows and apps.\nFrom Catalog, you can directly create and execute jobs for:\n\nWorkflows (such as Continuous Integration, testing automation, or Continuous Deployment) – These are the building blocks for creating higher-order workflows that perform jobs. You can also run the individually as a workflow. For details about creating a workflow, see Creating a Workflow.\n\nApplications (such as WordPress, Claudia) – These are full-fledged applications that can be used with no additional configuration.\n\nApplication Components (such as MySQL and PostgreSQL) – These items can be integrated with other applications and other components to create a more complex application.\n\nHere's the procedure for running a workflow or application from Catalog:\n\nFrom Navigation bar, click Catalog.\n\nSelect one of the categories (DEMO, DEVOPS, MONITORING, DATABASE, SECURITY, NETWORK) and choose RUN, TEST, DEPLOY or BUILD. (NOTE: The options vary by workflow and application.)\n\nCheck the values for the workflow parameters to ensure the inputs are correct.\nNOTE: Most input parameters have pre-filled values but some workflows need a specific configured value. For example, the \"Odoo App\" needs a URL for the DBHost input parameter, or the \"CI Workflow\" needs an email address for the REQUIRED_APPROVALS input parameter.\n\n(Optional) Click TEMPLATE to see a visual representation of the workflow steps and the source YAML code for the workflow.\n\nClick SUBMIT to execute the job.\nThe Console displays \"Successfully created a job for a Commit\".\n\n(Optional) Depending on the workflow, you may be asked to perform a step to complete the workflow (such as an email approval)\n\n\nWhen a job successfully completes, the Workflow screen displays a green circle for the last container that was run.\nCustomizing the Workflows\nAll workflows in the Catalog can be modified. To obtain the code in the YAML templates, go to the Argo App Store repo on GitHub.\nUnder the .argo directory, clone the YAML templates to create your custom workflows and applications. Make sure the cloned YAML templates are located in the .argo directory of your repo — this is where Argo looks for the YAML templates to run.\n"},"user_guide/applications/applications.md":{"id":"user_guide/applications/applications.md","title":"Running Applications and Deployments","body":"Building and Deploying Applications\nBesides building code and running workflows, the real power of the Argo lies in building a containerized application and deploying it as a set of long-running microservices.\nBefore jumping into how applications and deployments work, let's define what they mean:\n\nFor the Argo platform, an application is composed of a single service, a microservice or a group of microservices. Each microservice in an application represents a deployment.\nA deployment represents a microservice that is backed by a Docker container. For scalability purposes, a deployment may consist of multiple instances of a container.\nA major difference between these two entities is that applications generally have a longer lifetime than an instance of a deployment. In this context, an application represents the necessary resources to provide a service while a deployment represents the implementation of that service.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, the following diagram shows an application consisting of\n\nTwo deployments: a web server deployment and a database deployment.\nThe web server deployment has 2 instances running\nThe database server deployment has 1 instance running\n\n\n\nYou can view all applications that are available for deployment and their statuses on Argo:\n\nGo to Navigation bar > Applications.\nThis view displays the status of the application, whether it is running, stopped, terminated, or has generated an error.\nThis view also displays information about the last time the application was deployed or restarted.\n\nClick the name of the application to view details about the application (such as the number of deployments for an app, the number of instances for a deployment that are running).\n\nClick  on the name of the app and select View Spending to see the current cost of running the application for a specific time period.\n\nIn some cases, you may want to deploy and manage long-running services that are independent of a specific workflow. To identify each deployment, you assign it a name in the deployment type of YAML template. For configuration details, see Deployment Template.\nMonitoring and Scaling Deployments\n\nTo monitor the deployment of an app, click APPLICATIONS, click the name of the app you want to monitor, and then click the name of the deployment that is attached to the app.\nThis view shows whether a deployment is active or not, how many instances of the deployment are running, the spending details for the deployment. From this view, you can also start, stop, and scale the number of instances for your deployments easily.\nFrom this view, you can also see the configured internal and external routes for a deployment template under the END POINTS section.\n\nEXTERNAL ROUTES allow a deployment to be accessed outside of the Argo.\n\nINTERNAL ROUTES allow a deployment to be accessed by other deployments and jobs running within the same Argo. Internal routes are typically used to allow multiple microservices that are a part of the same application to communicate with each other. For example, suppose that you had an application that consists of a web app front end and a database backend. The network connection between these two deployments can be an internal route.\n\n\nIf you want to change the value of the routes, edit the YAML file for your deployment template. For details, see Deployment Template.\n\nTo scale the number of instances for a deployment, click the \"plus\" or \"minus\" sign under INSTANCES or enter a new number. Click CONFIRM to accept the change. Or click CANCEL to back out of the change.\n\n\nTo access the logs or console for an instance, click  for the instance, and select:\n\nLOGS to view the logs for the instance.\nCONSOLE to access the instance and enter custom commands for managing the instance. Click EXECUTE to perform the commands.\n\nRolling Updates for a Deployed Application\nTo avoid downtime of a running application, Argo allows you to update or rollback your application one pod at a time. To use this feature, you'll need to perform two tasks:\n\nConfigure your deployment YAML template to add a new section named \"strategy\" and two fields (max_surge and max_unavailable).\n\nUse the Argo Web UI to initiate the rolling update on a specified deployment.\n\n\nConfiguring a Deployment Template for a Rolling Update\nIn the Deployment YAML template, you'll need to add the following configuration information:\n\nA new section named \"strategy\" with the keys \"type\" and \"rolling_update\".\nTwo new fields to control the rate of rolling updates:\nmax_surge – maximum number of additional pods to create during a rolling update.\nmax_unavailable – maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during a rolling update.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to take down a pod first and then bring up a new pod, then you would set max_surge=0 and max_unavailable=1. This configuration means no additional pods are added during the upgrade and there will be one pod unavailable during the upgrade.\nHowever, if you want to create a new pod first before you tear down the old pod, then you could set max_surge=1 and max_unavailable=0.

In other words, you cannot have a update state where no additional pods can be added and no pods can be unavailable—in this state, Argo cannot execute a rolling update.

The checkers are available for Linux, Apple MacOS, and Microsoft Windows operating systems and they can be downloaded directly from the Argo Console.\nThe Argo DSL provides six types of YAML templates:\n\nContainer Template – for running a single container; you can specify its parameters (such as a Java build container, Selenium test container, or MySQL DB container)\nWorkflow Template – for specifying the job to run; think of it as a “short-running app” because a job “terminates” when it is completed.(such as Continuous Integration or Continuous Deployment workflows). Can be run manually or triggered by a policy. Each step in a workflow can be a container or another workflow.\nPolicy Templates – for defining rules that trigger a job or notification. Policies are applied to other templates (such as a policy to automatically trigger jobs for every commit)\nDeployment Template – for specifying a long-running service (such as a microservice or application). Can be run manually or triggered by a policy.\nFixture Template– for defining fixture classes that represent resources outside of the Argo. In order for a workflow or application to use these resources with Argo, you must define a fixture class. See Creating a fixture class for a workflow for an example.\nProject Templates – for defining apps or workflows that can be accessed in the Argo Catalog\n\nOut of the box, Argo provides YAML templates as pre-configured, reusable workflows and applications in Argo’s public GitHub repository (“repo”). This repo contains YAML templates for core microservices (such as checking out code from a Source Code Management system and an approval workflow) that can be used as \"building blocks\" for your own workflows and application s. You can clone them and modify the YAML templates to fit your needs.\n"},"yaml/container_templates.md":{"id":"yaml/container_templates.md","title":"Container Templates","body":"Container Template\nA container template contains the following sections.\nCommon Name and Type\n\ntype: container\nversion: the the Argo DSL version of the YAML template\nname: the unique name of the object\ndescription: (Optional), describes the object for the benefit of the users.\n\nimage - the docker container image.

The pattern is in the form of a tar pattern.\n\n\n\nsteps\nThis section describes the steps in a workflow. The steps section is mutually exclusive to the container section. A workflow only uses other containers and workflows, and never defines a container itself.\nA workflow can contain any number of steps in an array. The steps are executed in sequence, and if one step fails, the workflow fails and aborts the steps that follow.\nNOTE: Each step can also contain multiple tasks, which can be run in parallel. Multiple tasks within a step are indicated by a step name that is NOT preceded by a hyphen (\"-\"). If any of the tasks in a step fails, the remaining tasks in the same step still execute to completion, but the overall step fails.\nThe steps section contains:\n\nAn array of step objects. Each step object contains\n\nA map of task name to task object mapping. The task name must be unique within the whole workflow, not just within the step.\n\nThe task object contains the following fields.\n\ntemplate: the name of the YAML template that this step runs.\n\narguments - a map of the parameter name to its value mapping. Both the parameter name and its value have a \"fully qualified\" reference.\nFields that describe a Docker container:\n\nimage - the docker container image. Same as what you would provide to docker pull.\ncommand: a string that specifies the command to run in the container.\nargs is an array of arguments for the command.\nresources: the system resource that the container can use.\nmem_mib - amount of memory in MiB the service is expected to use.

Argo only supports the \"-e\", \"-p\" options, although the use of \"-p\" option is strongly discouraged, because it limits the ability to migrate the Docker container.\n\n\n\nFlags for exception handling\nIn many cases, you will want to specially handle errors and exceptions that occur during workflows. Two special flags are provided for this purpose:\n\nignore_error - Ignore any errors/failures for the specified step. The step always succeeds.\n\nalways_run - Always run this step before exiting the current sequence of steps.\n\n\nIn the following code snippet, the cleanup step is always run even if the job fails or is canceled during the setup or test phase. Furthermore, any errors during the cleanup step will be ignored and cannot fail the workflow.\nsteps:\n- setup:\n    template: mysetup\n- test:\n    template: mytest\n- cleanup:\n    template: mycleanup\n    flags:\n        always_run: true\n        ignore_error: true\nSteps executed sequentially\n---\ntype: workflow\nversion: 1\nname: basic-workflow-inline\ndescription: Basic workflow steps using containers\ninputs:\n  parameters:\n    COMMIT:\n      default: \"%%session.commit%%\"\n    REPO:\n      default: \"%%session.repo%%\"\nsteps:\n- STEP1:\n    image: alpine:latest\n    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\"]\n    args: [\"echo 'sleeping for 2 minutes' ; sleep 120; echo 'done'\"]\n- STEP2:\n    image: alpine:latest\n    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\"]\n    args: [\"echo 'sleeping for 2 minutes' ; sleep 120; echo 'done'\"]\nwhere:\n- STEP1 is the name of the first step.

When my test fails, I can't don't see any failure messages in my logs.\nA. You need to identify where in the process of running a job the failure occurred. From the Jobs view in the Timeline of the Argo Web UI, look for the left-most container or workflow that has a red circle. This indicates the part of the process that failed. For example, if the deployment step shows a red circle and there are no error messages in that log, this means the failure occurred earlier in the process. In this case, you could check an earlier step, such as the workflow logs to see what part of the YAML code failed.\nQ. My YAML code failed on one of the parameters.\nA. Your YAML code was grabbing something that wasn't created. Argo has YAML checker to verify that the YAML code is valid.\nQ. How does Argo manage artifacts that are produced by a job?\nA. There are two ways Argo manages artifacts. Internally, the Argo system manages artifacts for you. Use the internal system when you only need to use them for an application. Create names for the artifact and you can reference them in any workflow or job. The other method is to use an external storage system to manage your artifacts. This is useful when you need to distribute binary files. Argo is pre-integrated with the Nexus Repository for storing artifacts.\nQ. How do I find out how much usage the Kubernetes cluster is using versus Argo cluster in the AWS system?\nA. Use the Argo Claudia application to learn where your resources are being consumed in AWS. For each AWS account, you have groups that you can view. Claudia allows you to create custom groups so you can view more specific subsets of the AWS cost and usage. You can view data as recent as the last few minutes instead of having to wait 12 hours before the next AWS report is available.\nQ. Why should I run spot instances versus on-demand? Aren't spot instances more costly to run?\nA. The proper use of spot instances in AWS can dramatically reduce your spend on running instances. (How do you do this?)\nQ. My workflow is failing and I'm getting this log message \"ax_gzip_ax: stdout: Cannot allocate memory\". How can I fix this?\nA. For this type of message, Argo recommends that you increase the mem_mib setting in the corresponding container template.\nQ.Install error - \"An error occurred (Unsupported) when calling the RunInstances operation: The requested configuration is currently not supported. Please check the documentation for supported configuration\"\nA. This error occurs when you try to install Argo in a region where the supported instance type needed is not valid.As the Argo installer persists installation settings and reuses these in subsequent installations of cluster with the same name. This is done to make sure that installation is idempotent and can be retried multiple times.\nTo reinstall your cluster with new settings you need to uninstall it first using following command :\nargocluster uninstall --cluster-name argo-cluster --cloud-provider aws --cloud-profile default\nand install it again with new valid
