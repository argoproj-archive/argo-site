Each microservice in an application represents a deployment.\nA deployment represents a microservice that is backed by a Docker container. For scalability purposes, a deployment may consist of multiple instances of a container.\nA major difference between these two entities is that applications generally have a longer lifetime than an instance of a deployment. In this context, an application represents the necessary resources to provide a service while a deployment represents the implementation of that service.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, the following diagram shows an application consisting of\n\nTwo deployments: a web server deployment and a database deployment.\nThe web server deployment has 2 instances running\nThe database server deployment has 1 instance running\n\n\n\nFrom the Applications tab, you can view all applications that are available for deployment on your Argo.\nHere's how you view the status of an active application:\n\nGo to Applications.\nThis view displays the status of the application, whether it is running, stopped, terminated, or has generated an error.\nThis view also displays information about the last time the application was deployed or restarted.\n\nClick the name of the application to view details about the application.\n\nClick SPENDING to view how much has been spent running the application for a specific time period.\n\nIn some cases, you may want to deploy and manage long-running services that are independent of a specific workflow. To identify each deployment, you assign it a name in the deployment type of YAML template. For configuration details, see Creating a Deployment as a Long Running Service.\nMonitoring and Scaling Deployments\n\nFrom APPLICATIONS view, click DEPLOYMENTS to view whether a deployment is active or not and how many instances of a deployment are running.\nFrom DEPLOYMENTS, you can start, stop, and scale your deployments easily. You can also terminate or stop an instance from the dropdown menu.\n\nClick the name of the deployment to get a summary of details, including the spending details for the deployment.\n\nTo scale the number of instances for a deployment, click EDIT SCALE and select a new number. Click CONFIRM to accept the change. Or click CANCEL to back out of the change.\n\nWhile viewing the deployment details, click Instances to see the unique identifier for each instance of the deployment and whether the instance is still running or is terminated. For each instance displayed, you can\n\nClick LOGS to view the logs for the instance.\nClick CONSOLE to access the instance and enter custom commands for managing the instance. Click EXECUTE to perform the commands.\n\nFrom the Endpoints view, you can also see the internal and external routes for a deployment template.\nEXTERNAL ROUTES allow a deployment to be accessed outside of the Argo.\nINTERNAL ROUTES allow a deployment to be accessed by other deployments and jobs running within the same Argo. Internal routes are typically used to allow multiple microservices that are a part of the same application to communicate with each other. For example, suppose that you had an application that consists of a web app front end and a database backend. The network connection between these two deployments can be an internal route.\nFor details about configuring the routes, see Creating a Deployment as a Long Running Service.\nRolling Updates for a Deployed Application\nTo avoid downtime of a running application, Argo allows you to update or rollback your application one pod at a time. To use this feature, you'll need to perform two tasks:\n\nConfigure your deployment YAML template to add a new section named \"strategy\" and two fields (max_surge and max_unavailable).\n\nUse the Argo Web UI to initiate the rolling update on a specified deployment.\n\n\nConfiguring a Deployment Template for a Rolling Update\nIn the Deployment YAML template, you'll need to add the following configuration information:\n\nA new section named \"strategy\" with the keys \"type\" and \"rolling_update\".\nTwo new fields to control the rate of rolling updates:\nmax_surge – maximum number of additional pods to create during a rolling update.\nmax_unavailable – maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during a rolling update.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to take down a pod first and then bring up a new pod, then you would set max_surge=0 and max_unavailable=1. This configuration means no additional pods are added during the upgrade and there will be one pod unavailable during the upgrade.\nHowever, if you want to create a new pod first before you tear down the old pod, then you could set max_surge=1 and max_unavailable=0. This configuration means one new pod is added during the upgrade and before the old pod is torn down--there is only one pod that is unavailable during the upgrade.\nNOTE: A configuration setting of max_surge=0 and max_unavailable=0 is not allowed. In other words, you cannot have a update state where no additional pods can be added and no pods can be unavailable—in this state, Argo cannot execute a rolling update.

The reference information explains\n\nthe valid sections for each type of YAML template.\n\nthe types of inputs/outputs that a template accepts.\n\nany special values that a parameter can take.\n\n\nAbout the Argo YAML Templates\nThe automation of the public cloud infrastructure is driven by YAML templates that are written in the Argo Domain Specific Language. (DSL). You write YAML templates for specifying workflows, deployments, and applications that run on Argo. The specifications in the YAML templates are treated like code and are hosted in source code management (SCM) systems with your application code.\nArgo also provides a syntax and consistency checkers to validate the YAML definitions. The checkers are available for Linux, Apple MacOS, and Microsoft Windows operating systems and they can be downloaded directly from the Argo Console.\nThe Argo DSL provides six types of YAML templates:\n\nContainer Template – for running a single container; you can specify its parameters (such as a Java build container, Selenium test container, or MySQL DB container)\nWorkflow Template – for specifying the job to run; think of it as a “short-running app” because a job “terminates” when it is completed.(such as Continuous Integration or Continuous Deployment workflows). Can be run manually or triggered by a policy. Each step in a workflow can be a container or another workflow.\nPolicy Templates – for defining rules that trigger a job or notification. Policies are applied to other templates (such as a policy to automatically trigger jobs for every commit)\nDeployment Template – for specifying a long-running service (such as a microservice or application).

In order for a workflow or application to use these resources with Argo, you must define a fixture class. See Creating a fixture class for a workflow for an example.\nProject Templates – for creating apps or workflows that can be accessed in the Argo Catalog\n\nOut of the box, Argo provides YAML templates as pre-configured, reusable workflows and applications in Argo’s public GitHub repository (“repo”). This repo contains YAML templates for core microservices (such as checking out code from a Source Code Management system and an approval workflow) that can be used as \"building blocks\" for your own workflows and application s.

A workflow only uses other containers and workflows, and never defines a container itself.\nA workflow can contain any number of steps in an array. The steps are executed in sequence, and if one step fails, the workflow fails and aborts the steps that follow.\nNOTE: Each step can also contain multiple tasks, which can be run in parallel. Multiple tasks within a step are indicated by a step name that is NOT preceded by a hyphen (\"-\"). If any of the tasks in a step fails, the remaining tasks in the same step still execute to completion, but the overall step fails.\nThe steps section contains:\n\nAn array of step objects. Each step object contains\n\nA map of task name to task object mapping. The task name must be unique within the whole workflow, not just within the step.\n\nThe task object contains the following fields.\n\ntemplate: the name of the YAML template that this step runs.\n\narguments - a map of the parameter name to its value mapping. Both the parameter name and its value have a \"fully qualified\" reference.\nFields that describe a Docker container:\n\nimage - the docker container image.

Two special flags are provided for this purpose:\n\nignore_error - Ignore any errors/failures for the specified step. The step always succeeds.\n\nalways_run - Always run this step before exiting the current sequence of steps.\n\n\nIn the following code snippet, the cleanup step is always run even if the job fails or is canceled during the setup or test phase. Furthermore, any errors during the cleanup step will be ignored and cannot fail the workflow.\n\nsteps:\n\nsetup:\n  template: mysetup\n\ntest:\n  template: mytest\n\ncleanup:\n  template: mycleanup\n  flags:\n  always_run: true\n\n  ignore_error: true\n\n\nSteps executed sequentially\n---\ntype: workflow\nversion: 1\nname: basic-workflow-inline\ndescription: Basic workflow steps using containers\ninputs:\n  parameters:\n    COMMIT:\n      default: \"%%session.commit%%\"\n    REPO:\n      default: \"%%session.repo%%\"\nsteps:\n- STEP1:\n    image: alpine:latest\n    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\"]\n    args: [\"echo 'sleeping for 2 minutes' ; sleep 120; echo 'done'\"]\n- STEP2:\n    image: alpine:latest\n    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\"]\n    args: [\"echo 'sleeping for 2 minutes' ; sleep 120; echo 'done'\"]\nwhere:\n- STEP1 is the name of the first step.

When my test fails, I can't don't see any failure messages in my logs .\nA. You need to identify where in the process of running a job the failure occurred. From the Jobs view in the Timeline of the Argo Web UI, look for the left-most container or workflow that has a red circle. This indicates the part of the process that failed. For example, if the deployment step shows a red circle and there are no error messages in that log, this means the failure occurred earlier in the process. In this case, you could check an earlier step, such as the workflow logs to see what part of the YAML code failed.\nQ. My YAML code failed on one of the parameters.....\nA. Your YAML code was grabbing something that wasn't created. Argo has YAML checker to verify that the YAML code is valid.\nQ. How does Argo manage artifacts that are produced by a job?\nA. There are two ways Argo manages artifacts. Internally, the Argo system manages artifacts for you. Use the internal system when you only need to use them for an application? Create names for the artifact and you can reference them in any workflow or job. The other method is to use an external storage system to manage your artifacts. This is useful when you need to distribute binary files. Argo is pre-integrated with the Nexus Repository for storing artifacts.\nQ. How do I find out how much usage the Kubernetes cluster is using versus Argo cluster in the AWS system?\nA. Use the Argo Claudia application to learn where your resources are being consumed in AWS. For each AWS account, you have groups that you can view. Claudia allows you to create custom groups so you can view more specific subsets of the AWS cost and usage. You can view data as recent as the last few minutes instead of having to wait 12 hours before the next AWS report is available.\nQ. Why should I run spot instances versus on-demand? Aren't spot instances more costly to run?\nA. The proper use of spot instances in AWS can dramatically reduce your spend on running instances. (How do you do this?)\nQ. My workflow is failing and I'm getting this log message \"ax_gzip_ax: stdout: Cannot allocate memory\". How can I fix this?\nA. For this type of message, Argo recommends that you increase the mem_mib setting in the corresponding container template.\nQ. What are the minimum resource requirements for Argo if I'm running it on AWS?\nA. You must have a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a subnet that can access a NAT gateway. (The creator instance will need to download the software to install.) Along with the VPC, you must provision the resource types listed in the following table:\n\nNOTE: For EC2 Instance Type, choose either STANDARD or COMPUTE OPTIMIZED.\n\n\n\n\nResource Type\nCount\n\n\n\n\nElastic IP\n1\n\n\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC)\n1\n\n\nS3 Buckets\n2\n\n\nEC2 Instance Type: STANDARD Cluster Size: SMALL **Master** node size: m3.medium **Argo System** node size: m3.large **User** node size: m3.large\n1 2 1\n\n\nEC2 Instance Type: STANDARD Cluster Size: MEDIUM **Master** node size: m3.large **Argo System** node size: m3.large **User** node size: m3.large\n1 2 1\n\n\nEC2 Instance Type: STANDARD Cluster Size: LARGE **Master** node size: r3.large **Argo System** node size: m3.large **User** node size: m3.large\n1 3 1\n\n\nEC2 Instance Type: STANDARD Cluster Size: XLARGE **Master** node size: r3.2xlarge **Argo System** node size: m3.2xlarge **User** node size: m3.2xlarge\n1 2 1\n\n\nEC2 Instance Type: COMPUTE OPTIMIZED Cluster Size: SMALL **Master** node size: m3.medium **Argo System** node size: m3.large **User** node size: c3.2xlarge\n1 2 1\n\n\nEC2 Instance Type: COMPUTE OPTIMIZED Cluster Size: MEDIUM **Master** node size: m3.large **Argo System** node size: m3.large **User** node size: c3.2xlarge\n1 2 1\n\n\nEC2 Instance Type: COMPUTE OPTIMIZED Cluster Size: LARGE **Master**node size: r3.large **Argo System** node size: m3.large **User** node size: c3.2xlarge\n1 3 1\n\n\nEC2 Instance Type: COMPUTE OPTIMIZED Cluster Size: XLARGE **Master** node size: r3.xlarge **Argo System** node size: m3.xlarge **User** node size: c3.2xlarge\n1 3 1\n\n\nAuto Scaling Group\n3\n\n\nLaunch Configuration\n3\n\n\nElastic Load Balancer*****\n2\n\n\nServer certificates stored in an AWS account******\n1\n\n\n***** If you are using webhooks, add 1 more Elastic Load Balancer. ****** To check the number of server certificates you are currently using on AWS, you can use the AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI) to access this information.
